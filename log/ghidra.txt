Install Ghidra, the NSA's open-source reverse engineering tool: https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html#Install
    - On OSX, this self-contained .app is very useful https://gist.github.com/yifanlu/e9965cdb148b550335e57899f790cad2
Install useful GameCube extensions:
    - Gekko and Broadway CPU language definitions. The GameCube uses a specialized PowerPC CPU. These definitions contain human-readable names for assembly commands. https://github.com/aldelaro5/ghidra-gekko-broadway-lang
    - The Ghidra GameCube Loader allows parsing of .dol and .rel files (GameCube's binary executable formats). Also includes support for loading .map symbols; Perfect, because Wind Waker ships with them! https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader
Extra the .dol and .map from the Wind Waker ISO using Dolphin. 
    - Add the ISO to Dolphin's game list
    - Right-click it, Properties, Filesystem:
    - Right-click Disc at the top of the tree, Extract System Data..., and copy the resulting main.dol file.
Add main.dol and all the .rels to the ghidra project
    - Needs instructions
Load Jasper's Ghydra binary with symbols: https://noclip.website/priv/WindWaker/main.dol.gzf

Mark all _savegpr_*, _savefpr_*, _restgpr_*, and _restfpr_* functions as inline
    - Search for '_save' in the Symbol Tree window
    - Right click on each function and select 'Edit Function'
    - Check the 'In Line' attribute in the Function Attributes section of the Edit Function window
    - If this is not done, most functions will have a call to save_gpr_* at the top and will fail to correctly
        determine parameter types. This makes it harder to find references to member variables
